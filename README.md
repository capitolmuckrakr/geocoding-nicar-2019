## What is geocoding?

Often we get a dataset with an address for each record, and often we would like to place that address on a map. In order to do that, you need to translate your addresses to latitude/longitude coordinates. The process a computer uses to calculate the coordinates for an address so it can place it on a map is known as geocoding.

### Which one is latitude again?

Latitude = Y axis (north and south)  
Longitude = X axis (east and west) -- Think long and not tall 

### OK are we geocoding yet?

No, we are going to talk about boring but important things first.

## How many things do you need to geocode?

1 thing: Google it.
10 things: Google them.
100 things: You have so many choices!
50,000 things: OoooOooooOOOooooo. Meet the Texas A&M Geocoder.*

_*Or do it with the Google Geocoding API, if you're going to put it on a Google Map._

## Do you have/need address-level data or city-level data?
